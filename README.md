OBJLoad
=======

Description
-----------

A little Ruby script I made for a Computer Graphics class to load a .obj file directly into header/code files. The resulting code creates the vertex, texture coordinate, normal and face lists necessary to render the object in OpenGL.

Future Changes
-------------

* Reduce the filesize of resulting C++ code
* Allow the C++ headers to use windowing toolkits other than GLUT (ugh!)
* Add support for other file formats (Direct X, 3dsMax, etc)
* Convert to other languages
